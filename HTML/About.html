          <h1>History</h1>
          <p>
            ERamen's story began in 1910 in a small town in Japan when a passionate ramen enthusiast named Hiroshi Tanaka opened a humble noodle stall. Hiroshi was dedicated to perfecting the art of ramen-making, and his flavorful creations quickly gained popularity among locals and travelers alike. Over the years, his ramen shop became renowned for its authentic flavors and exceptional quality, earning it a reputation as one of the oldest and most beloved ramen establishments in the world.
<br><br>
            In 2015, inspired by the global demand for authentic Japanese cuisine, Hiroshi's descendants expanded the legacy of ERamen beyond Japan and opened their first international branch in Indonesia. With a desire to share their family's century-old tradition and passion for ramen, ERamen quickly became a favorite among Indonesian food enthusiasts, continuing the rich heritage of the brand in a new cultural setting.
